/*
OOPs. refers to languages that use objects in programming.

why?
    make code easier to understand how a program works by bringing
    together data and its behavior (or method) in a single bundle
    called an object.

Object-oriented programming aims to implement real-world entities like
        inheritance,
        hiding(abstraction and encapsulation),
        polymorphism etc.

Prerequisites:
Method declaration:
        Access Modifier(public private etc.)
        The return type
        Method Name
        Parameter list
        Exception list
        Method body
Method passing (information sharing between objects)

    Class
    Object
    Method and method passing
    Pillars of OOPs
        Abstraction
        Encapsulation
        Inheritance
        Polymorphism
            Compile-time polymorphism
            Runtime polymorphism
